/*

Let's focus on frontend code for now and then we'll work on backend okay?

So at frontend, I am using plain HTML, Tailwind CSS, vanilla JS with fetch.

UI:
1. Input Key - input field to enter the key
2. Submit button - to process the key at backend
3. Process Status Indicator - display the status of the process: "Processing In Background", "Process Completed", "Failed"
4. Data - display the data using flexbox with columns: "S. No.", "Key", "Value", "Button (Change Color)"

Functionality:
1. User enters the key and clicks on submit button
2. Process Status Indicator is updated to "Processing In Background"
3. The key is sent to backend for processing
4. UI is not blocked and user can continue to interact with the UI
5. User can click on "Change Color" button to change the color of the row
6. Once the processing done at backend in background, the Process Status Indicator is updated to "Process Completed"
7. The data is updated in the Data section
8. If the processing fails, the Process Status Indicator is updated to "Failed"
