CSS Selectors:
--------------

Certainly! Here are key points about CSS selectors, which are used to target and style HTML elements:

1. Element Selector:

- Syntax: Selects elements based on their tag name.
  
  ```css
  p {
    /* Styles applied to all <p> elements */
  }
  ```

2. Class Selector:

- Syntax: Selects elements with a specific class attribute.

  ```css
  .highlight {
    /* Styles applied to all elements with class="highlight" */
  }
  ```

- Usage in HTML:

  ```html
  <p class="highlight">This is a highlighted paragraph.</p>
  ```

3. ID Selector:

- Syntax: Selects a single element with a specific id attribute.

  ```css
  #header {
    /* Styles applied to the element with id="header" */
  }
  ```

- Usage in HTML:

  ```html
  <div id="header">This is the header.</div>
  ```

4. Attribute Selector:

- Syntax: Selects elements based on their attributes.

  ```css
  input[type="text"] {
    /* Styles applied to text input elements */
  }
  ```

5. Descendant Selector:

- Syntax: Selects an element that is a descendant of another specified element.

  ```css
  article p {
    /* Styles applied to <p> elements inside <article> elements */
  }
  ```

6. Adjacent Sibling Selector:

- Syntax: Selects an element that is immediately preceded by a specified element.

  ```css
  h2 + p {
    /* Styles applied to <p> elements immediately following <h2> elements */
  }
  ```

7. Pseudo-Classes:

- Syntax: Selects elements based on their state or position.

  ```css
  a:hover {
    /* Styles applied to links on hover */
  }

  li:first-child {
    /* Styles applied to the first <li> within its parent */
  }
  ```

8. Pseudo-Elements:

- Syntax: Selects parts of an element, such as the first line or first letter.

  ```css
  p::first-line {
    /* Styles applied to the first line of <p> elements */
  }

  p::first-letter {
    /* Styles applied to the first letter of <p> elements */
  }
  ```

9. Universal Selector:

- Syntax: Selects all elements on a page.

  ```css
  * {
    /* Styles applied to all elements */
  }
  ```

10. Grouping Selectors:

- Syntax: Allows you to apply the same styles to multiple selectors.

  ```css
  h1, h2, h3 {
    /* Styles applied to <h1>, <h2>, and <h3> elements */
  }
  ```

These are some of the fundamental CSS selectors. Understanding and mastering these selectors is essential for creating well-styled and responsive web designs. Combining and nesting selectors allows for precise targeting of HTML elements.
