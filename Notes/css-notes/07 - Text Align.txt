Text Align:
-----------

The `text-align` property in CSS is used to specify the horizontal alignment of text within an element. Here are key points and notes regarding the `text-align` property:

1. Basic Usage:

- The `text-align` property is applied to a container element to define the horizontal alignment of its text content.

  ```css
  selector {
    text-align: value;
  }
  ```

2. Possible Values:

- Left (`left`): Text is aligned to the left edge of the container.
  
  ```css
  .left-align {
    text-align: left;
  }
  ```

- Right (`right`): Text is aligned to the right edge of the container.

  ```css
  .right-align {
    text-align: right;
  }
  ```

- Center (`center`): Text is centered within the container.

  ```css
  .center-align {
    text-align: center;
  }
  ```

- Justify (`justify`): Text is justified, meaning it is spread out to align with both the left and right edges of the container.

  ```css
  .justify-align {
    text-align: justify;
  }
  ```

3. Inheritance:

- The `text-align` property is inherited, meaning it can be applied to child elements.

  ```css
  .parent {
    text-align: center;
  }

  .child {
    /* Inherits text-align: center from the parent */
  }
  ```

4. Applied to Inline and Inline-Block Elements:

- `text-align` can be applied to both block-level and inline-level elements.

  ```css
  p {
    text-align: right; /* Applied to block-level element */
  }

  span {
    text-align: center; /* Applied to inline-level element */
  }
  ```

5. Centering Block-Level Elements:

- To horizontally center block-level elements, often used in conjunction with `margin: auto;`.

  ```css
  .center-block {
    text-align: center;
  }

  .center-block img {
    margin: auto; /* Horizontally centers the image */
  }
  ```

6. Responsive Text Alignment:

- Media queries can be used to adjust text alignment based on the screen width.

  ```css
  @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    selector {
      text-align: center;
    }
  }
  ```

7. Vertical Alignment of Inline Elements:

- For vertically aligning inline elements within a line of text, use `vertical-align`.

  ```css
  img {
    vertical-align: middle; /* Vertically aligns the image with the text */
  }
  ```

8. Use Cases:

- Setting the alignment of headings, paragraphs, and other text elements.
- Creating centered layouts.
- Aligning text within navigation menus and buttons.

9. Note on `text-align-last`:

- The `text-align-last` property is used to set the alignment of the last line of text within an element. It is not widely supported in all browsers.

10. Considerations:

- When using `text-align: justify`, be cautious with its application, as it can sometimes lead to uneven spacing between words.

Understanding how to use `text-align` effectively is essential for controlling the layout and appearance of text content on your web page. It plays a crucial role in achieving a visually balanced and well-organized design.
