1. Why Use `!` When Declaring a Field in Class?
-----------------------------------------------

Definition:
  - In TypeScript, the `!` operator, also known as the non-null assertion operator,
  - It is used to tell the compiler that a variable or property is guaranteed to have a value and won't be `null` or `undefined` at runtime.

Understanding the Context:
    `name!: string;`
    - Here, `name!: string;` declares a property named `name` in a TypeScript class.
    - The `!` is applied after the type annotation (`string`).
    - This asserts to the compiler that `name` will always be of type `string` and will never be nullish.

2. Benefits of Using `!`:
-------------------------

- Improved Code Readability: It clarifies your intent that `name` is always expected to have a value.

- Potential Error Prevention: By asserting it's not nullish, you can avoid errors that might occur if you try to access properties or methods on a null or undefined `name`.

- Early Detection of Issues: The compiler might raise warnings or errors if it can't guarantee `name` is initialized, helping you catch issues early in development.

3. Important Considerations:
----------------------------

- Use `!` cautiously. If `name` can genuinely be null or undefined at some point, using `!` might mask potential runtime errors.
- Ensure proper initialization logic to guarantee `name` gets a value before it's used.
- In some cases, explicit nullish checks using conditionals (if statements) might be better for code clarity and handling potential nullish values.

4. Using Non-Null Assertion:
----------------------------

```TypeScript
    let username!: string; // Declares username as string and asserts it's not nullish

    function greetUser() {
      console.log("Hello, " + username.toUpperCase()); // (No Compile-time Error)
    }

    username = "John Doe";  // Before calling greetUser, ensure username is properly initialized with a string value
    greetUser();
```

- By adding !, you tell the compiler that username will always have a value, allowing the code to compile without errors.
- However, it's crucial to ensure username is indeed initialized before using it.

5. Non-Null Assertion vs. Nullish Coalescing Operator:
------------------------------------------------------

The non-null assertion operator (`!`) differs from the nullish coalescing operator (`??`). While `!` asserts a variable is not nullish, `??` provides a default value if the variable is null or undefined.

6. Summary:
-----------

- Non-null Assertion (`!`): Informs TypeScript a variable is guaranteed to have a value (not nullish).
- Syntax: `variableName!: type`.
- Benefits: Improves readability, prevents nullish access errors, aids early error detection.
- Cautions: Use cautiously, ensure proper initialization, consider explicit nullish checks when needed.
- Differs from Nullish Coalescing (`??`): `!` asserts not nullish, `??` provides a default value if nullish.
