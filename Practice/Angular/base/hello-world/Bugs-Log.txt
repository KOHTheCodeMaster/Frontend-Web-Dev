Issue Description:
------------------

- Attribute & Class Selectors are not working!
- Complete working example with use-case for both Attribute & Class Selector Components.

Resolution:
-----------

- Initially comp-attribute-selector & comp-class-selector not created via Angular CLI but rather manually cloned
  by copy-pasting the existing comp-element-selector and later refactored to class & attribute respectively.

- This led to typo error which made selectors for both attribute & class components to use same as element selector.

- Fixed by updating the selectors with correct syntax.

- Attribute Selector was defined as element selector before which is now fixed to its correct syntax.
  Before: selector: 'comp-attribute-selector',
  Fix:    selector: '[comp-attribute-selector]',

- Class Selector was defined as element selector before which is now fixed to its correct syntax.
  Before: ` selector: 'comp-attribute-selector', `
  Fix:    ` selector: '.comp-attribute-selector]', `
