HTML Heading Tags

HTML provides heading tags to define the hierarchical structure of your document. Headings are essential for organizing content and making it more readable. Here's a summary of HTML heading tags:

1. `<h1>`: Highest-level heading. Represents the main heading of the page. Use it sparingly for the most significant content.

2. `<h2>`: Subheading of `<h1>`. Use it to break down the main sections of the page.

3. `<h3>`: Subheading of `<h2>`. Use it for subsections within `<h2>` sections.

4. `<h4>`: Subheading of `<h3>`. Continue this pattern for deeper subsections.

5. `<h5>` and `<h6>`: Lower-level headings, with `<h6>` being the least significant. Use them for detailed subsections.

Key Points:

- HTML heading tags range from `<h1>` to `<h6`, with `<h1>` being the most important and `<h6>` the least.
- Use headings to create a clear hierarchy in your document.
- Search engines use headings to understand the content's structure and importance.
- Headings should be used in order (e.g., don't skip from `<h2>` to `<h4>`).
- You can style headings with CSS to control their appearance.
- Heading tags also influence the visual display of text; they are larger and bolder than regular text.
- Avoid using headings for purely stylistic purposes. Use CSS for styling instead.

Example:

```html
<h1>Main Title</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <p>Content of section 1 goes here.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <p>Content of section 2 goes here.</p>

    <h3>Subsection 2.1</h3>
    <p>Content of subsection 2.1 goes here.</p>
</section>

```

This simple structure helps both humans and search engines understand the organization of your content.
