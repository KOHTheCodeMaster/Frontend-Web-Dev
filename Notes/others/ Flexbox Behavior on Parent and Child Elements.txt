Flexbox Behavior with `display: flex` on Parent and Default Behavior of Child Elements:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction:
   - When a parent container has `display: flex` applied to it, it becomes a flex container, and its child elements inherit certain default behaviors.

2. Default Behavior of Child Elements:
   - Flexible Sizing: Child elements within a flex container adjust their widths based on their content, resembling the behavior of `width: fit`, although the rule itself isn't explicitly applied.
   - Equal Distribution: Child elements are distributed evenly along the main axis of the flex container by default.
   - Alignment: Child elements are aligned along the cross axis of the flex container by default.
   - Flexible Shrink: Child elements have a default `flex-shrink` value of `1`, allowing them to shrink in size if necessary to prevent overflow within the flex container.
   - No Wrapping: Child elements do not wrap onto new lines by default, staying on a single line along the main axis of the flex container.

3. Conclusion: The default behavior of child elements within a flex container is flexible and adaptive, resembling the behavior of `width: fit` without explicitly applying the rule.
